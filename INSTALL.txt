Badaap Comic Reader (BCR) Installation instructions

First a note on Security:
I've create multi-user support so members of my family each have their own settings and comic progress stats.
Badaap Comic Reader is meant to be used this way, not as a public website.
The security of Badaap Comic Reader therefore is very simple and inadequate for a public website.
Maybe this will change in the future, but for now, keep this in mind. 


Requirements:
- Windows XP/Vista/7
- Apache webserver >= 2.2 with PHP >= 5.3.
- Comics, preferably in CBZ format containing the ComicInfo.xml file created by ComicRack.

*** Apache installation ***
If you don't have a working Apache and PHP installation, you can install the WAMP server from http://www.wampserver.com/
No additional addons are required.
NB: WampServer is not meant to be used as a production server, so beware of security risks. Check the wampserver site for more info.

*** PHP installation ***
After installing WAMPServer, make sure the following extensions are enabled:
- sqlite3
- gd
- SimpleXML
- zip
- [optional] rar for CBR support. 

These can easily be turned on via the WampServer tray icon via "PHP > PHP extensions".

A note about CBR Support:
This is a bitch to install, as it's not distributed with most php installations, so finding the correct dll file is hard. 
Personnaly I wouldn't bother, I just convert all comics to CBZ in ComicRack.
This has the added advantage that ComicRack will write the ComicInfo.xml file into the CBZ file. 
ComicRack will not change CBR files (due to rar licensing restrictions).
However make sure you enabled this option in the ComicRack settings, because I think this is disabled by default.
The setting is "Advanced > Books > Allow writing of Book info into files", turn it on.


*** BCR installation ***
Put the BCR files in a folder accessible via Apache.
What I did is to create an apache alias directory to that folder.
You can do this via the WampServer tray icon menu via "Apache > Alias directories > Add an alias".
By default, WampServer creates a very restrictive alias, allowing only access from localhost.
As you want to access the site via your tablet, this needs to be fixed.
So edit the alias, also via the tray icon, and modify the permissions accordingly.

These are my complete alias settings:

Alias /comic "d:/bcr/comic/" 

<Directory "d:/bcr/comic/">
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
   AllowOverride all
   Require all granted
</Directory>

The url to my BCR install is now http://localhost/comic

NB: the alias created by WampServer has a trailing slash. Remove this, it makes life easier.

So 
Alias /comic/ "d:/bcr/comic/"
becomes
Alias /comic "d:/bcr/comic/" 


*** Configuration ***
Open config.php in a text editor and change the following options:

Absolute path to the database file. You don't want to have this accessible via your webserver, so this default should be changed.
$options["database"]= dirname(__FILE__)."/comics.sqlite"; 

Absolute path to the folder where you have all your comics.
$options["comicsfolder"]= "J:\\comics"; 

Next open the website.
If the database doesn't exist yet, a new one is created.
By default one user is created with administrator access level.
The login is: admin
The password is: admin

You can manage users via admin/usermanagement.php
