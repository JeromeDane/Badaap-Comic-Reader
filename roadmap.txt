This document describes the features I plan to add to ComicViewer.

Currently this project is still in the testing phase until I deem it worthy for a public release on GitHub.

0.1 - first public release:
- Add user management pages.
- Add comic book detail page, showing the ComicRack metadata from ComicInfo.xml
- Add global search feature. Now ComicViewer can only filter in the current folder.
- Think of a better name than ComicViewer.
- Create temporary application icons.
- Implement the view to modify the user settings.

Planned features:
- Create custom (smart)lists.
- Browse on Series.
- Import ComicDB.xml from ComicRack. Only useful for (smart)lists?
- Package ComicViewer into native app (e.g. via Phonegap).
- Download and store comics locally to the tablet for offline viewing.
- Retrieve data directly from ComicRack. (Not sure I want this, I don't want to have ComicRack running constantly.)
- Integrate / use the ComicRack Web Viewer plugin. (Not sure I want this, I don't want to have ComicRack running constantly.)
- Replace the php backend with a ComicRack plugin. In my opinion this is the only reason why I would want to keep ComicRack running.
