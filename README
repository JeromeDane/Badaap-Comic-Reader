ComicViewer is a web-based application for accessing and reading ALL your comics on the iPad and possibly other tablets.

Why another comic viewer?
Most comic book viewers for the iPad store the comics locally on the iPad.
Very large comic collections won't fit on a tablet, so I constantly have to delete comics from the iPad and upload new ones to it.
This has 2 major problems:
1. I have to decide beforehand what I want to read, which I don't want to.
2. I have to know which comics I have already read.

Problem 1 can be solved by giving my tablet access to all the comics I have.
Problem 2 can be solved by letting the tablet store which comics I have read.

Both problems can be solved by creating a web-app with a server-side component.

ComicViewer is composed of a server-side php application and a client-side javascript application.
