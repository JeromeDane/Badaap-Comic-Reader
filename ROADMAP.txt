This document describes the features I plan to add to Badaap Comic Reader.

Currently this project is still in the testing phase until I deem it worthy for a public release on GitHub.

0.1 - first public release:
- Added user management pages.
- Added comic book detail page, showing the ComicRack metadata from ComicInfo.xml
- Created temporary application icons.
- Implemented the view to modify the user settings.

Planned features:
- Add global search feature. Now BCR can only filter in the current folder.
- Browse on Series/Author/other fields.
- Create custom (smart)lists.
- Import ComicDB.xml from ComicRack. Only useful for (smart)lists?
- Download and store comics locally to the tablet for offline viewing.
- Retrieve data directly from ComicRack. (Not sure I want this, I don't want to have ComicRack running constantly.)
- Integrate / use the ComicRack Web Viewer plugin. (Not sure I want this, I don't want to have ComicRack running constantly.)
- Replace the apache/php backend with a ComicRack plugin. (In my opinion this is the only reason why I would want to keep ComicRack running.)
- Image cache management, currently extracted pages are never deleted.
- Recreate cover thumbnails.
- Theming support: icons, colors, fonts, images 
- Add Sencha Touch device profiles
- Optimize the Sencha Touch deployment for size/performance
- Package ComicViewer into native app (e.g. via Phonegap).
- Dropbox/other cloud storage support for downloading comics into local storage. If possible....
- Multipage thumbnail preview
- Show page thumbnail while sliding the page slider.
- Improve icons and layout
- Use image with type FrontCover for cover thumbnail instead of first image.
