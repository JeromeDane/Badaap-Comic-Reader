- Add global search feature. Now ComicViewer can only filter in the current folder.

- Implement the view to modify the user settings.




--- Planned features:
- Create custom (smart)lists.
- Browse on Series.
- Import ComicDB.xml from ComicRack. Only useful for (smart)lists?
- Package ComicViewer into native app (e.g. via Phonegap).
- Download and store comics locally to the tablet for offline viewing.
- Retrieve data directly from ComicRack. (Not sure I want this, I don't want to have ComicRack running constantly.)
- Integrate / use the ComicRack Web Viewer plugin. (Not sure I want this, I don't want to have ComicRack running constantly.)
- Replace the php backend with a ComicRack plugin. (In my opinion this is the only reason why I would want to keep ComicRack running.)
- Image cache management, currently extracted pages are never deleted.
- Recreate cover thumbnails.
